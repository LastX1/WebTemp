        <h1>Down for now but not for good</h1>
        <p>The old computer I was using as a server to host this website has sadly died and I lack
            all forms of funding to make another one so as of 3/9/2025 it is currently down until I 
            can secure more money to bring this project of my highly used website back. 
            <br>
            <p>
            If you want
            to assist me in trying to bring back this website and keep it back you can donate to my 
            cashapp "Corner1573" All forms of donations are welcome but not required.
            </p>
            <br>
            Thank you all for allowing me to host this website and have it used by many
            <br>
            Sincerely, Last X
        </p>
